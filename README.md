# Kotlin Player

My first Kotlin App created in the course of Antonio Leiva :computer: [@lime_cl](http://twitter.com/lime_cl) (https://devexperto.com)

## About the app

This app shows dummy photos and videos from [Lorem Pixel](http://lorempixel.com/) in a grid. You can filter them by photos or videos and you can view its detail as well.

## What's in the app?

This application shows concepts such as:

* **The project**: create an Android project and modify it with Kotlin
* **Kotlin Android Extensions**: how to retrieve the XML layouts without `findViewById`
* **Classes and functions**: diferences between Java and Kotlin and data classes
* **Variables and properties**: mutable and inmutable values and type inference
* **Lambdas**: simplify our work and new posibilities
* **Interfaces**: can include code, not like Java
* **Extension functions**: how to add extra functions to classes that you can't access the code
* **Operator overloading**: how to write a class that implement the common operators
* **Delegated properties**: how to reuse code throught delegation
* **Functional operations in collections**: how Kotlin resolve the collection treatment
* **Security having nulls**: bye bye `NullPointerException`
* **Sealed classes**: classes that works like enums
* **Anko**: features of the [library](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko) for development in Android
